# About Vviped
Problem : COVID-19 pandemic has led to Global economic crisis and turned market behavior on consumption. People tends to save their money. However the trend also shows that [people, especially Indonesians are still willing to make a donation](https://www.liputan6.com/health/read/3987796/indonesia-melesat-jadi-negara-paling-dermawan-di-dunia). **We need a platform to fill the gap between the desire of make donation and the need to save money.**

Idea / Solution : An app which helps anyone who wants to **donate by selling their goods with bidding and enable anyone who wants to buy goods in both the lowest dan highest prices (for pride) as possible**. In short, it's a modern-high-tech social e-commerce.
